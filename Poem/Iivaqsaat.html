  <h3>I. Light</h3>

  <p>
    The seal talked to me with sharp eyes in my dream.<br>
    Altered, I was able to be with both of you mothers.<br>
    Light the seal oil lamp, elder women, as I draw thunder<br>
    from the sky at dusk. Water crests on the river sound like beams<br>
    touching the surface or a spark crystal in a whiteout.<br>
    A flare falls on the edge of the ocean, I shudder at the black dry snow.<br>
    Seldom have I thought of rapid growth in years,<br>
    you both with heads of hair like whalebone strings,<br>
    white, and tenacious. I seldom listen to only one voice<br>
    or, to only those standing in a row in the night. They stand up<br>
    as rays of sunstrokes just when the night turns to a gleam ripple<br>
    on the glass water. Then as the ligature of Inuit light flux and flows<br>
    like herds of walrus, passing along the coast, Yes then, but maybe<br>
    this is a seal hook of bear claws clipping me to the northern tilt,<br>
    pinning me to the cycle of night when the day slows, the wind<br>
    shifts to cloud, and the moon shadow grows to sun loops.<br>
    It is then I answer the coal seal eyes with throat song,<br>
    standing on one strong foot in dance with white gloves.<br>
  </p>

  <h3>II. Natural World Adoption</h3>

  <p>
    I learned to crack mussel shells, to collect moss on rocks,<br>
    save strewn caribou hides across malleable tundra,<br>
    how to stop my finger joints from cracking in frost,<br>
    to dye my hair garnet to fit in, to feel earthquakes,<br>
    uprooting soapstone and jade, to count milliseconds<br>
    by watching a brook run, to count cracks in an ice floe,<br>
    to drink water from a horsetail reed. Now my ball and sockets<br>
    rub and roll like hummocks bound and rivet the northern tip<br>
    of the Rockies. I read books until my eyes chart points in words<br>
    down 4000 miles in desert sounds. My tongue clipped to the brow antler,<br>
    the words rubbing sealskin to make thunder then lightning.<br>
    I guide the harpoon-line hanging in the singing house with many blessed eggs<br>
    for mothers, for children. I stitch you around my eyes, down my chin,<br>
    though my altered states to remember it is you who guards me<br>
    from long ice needles. Is it you threading the singe on my sealskin,<br>
    patching letters tied to ink blood. I am seeing only will-full DNA<br>
    tattooed to the snow knife for cutting ice blocks of chins,<br>
    perhaps for a house, a shelter, a lean to in a starved storm but,<br>
    had I not prayed for this moment, this dissension into fish or birds,<br>
    if what I wanted was to make it until the large stocks of dried<br>
    musk oxen are gone. Then, I choose sable day and flux night.<br>
